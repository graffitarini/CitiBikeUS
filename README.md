# CitiBikeUS

In this project, we will be exploring data associated with the New York City bike share program, Citi Bike! Remember, it may be easiest to read these instructions by clicking on the "Preview" button in RStudio.

There are over 850 Citi Bike stations in New York City; users check a bike out from a starting station and then dock that bike at a different station when they reach their destination. Citi Bike offers a variety of memberships, but most memberships allow for trips between 30 and 45 minutes; this will be relevant once we start digging into the dataset.

Citi Bike publically releases a variety of datasets. We've included a dataset containing information about individual trips from January of 2020. If you'd like to download a more recent dataset, or investigate other data that Citi Bike provides, take a look at their [System Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) page. 

Visualization 

We now have the average speed of every age in our dataset. Letâ€™s use ggplot2 to make a line graph to see if younger people really do bike faster. This visualization gives us some great insights on how Citi Bike users are using their bikes.
